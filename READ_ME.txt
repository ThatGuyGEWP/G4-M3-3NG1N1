Thank you for using Version 7 of my
python game engine! (G@M3 3NG1N3)

THIS IS AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT, YOU MAY MAKE ANY EDITS TO THE CODE WITHOUT RESTRICTION, REMEMBER THAT!

This simplifys some functions to make game creation or overall creation with the python laungage easier!

to remove the "Powered by G4M3 3NG1N3"
remove the "openz()" function at the beging of main.py

Tips:
Look in examples.txt for documentation on use of the game engine

Functions:
 wait(Time)
  Replace 'Time' with any number and the
  script will wait that amount of time

 clear(None) 
  [Dont put anything between the '()']
   This function clears the output of the console


 typeEffect(string,timePerLetter,HoldTim)
  Dose a cool effect that the intro of the engine has, to type the text you want, do: "Your text" ,with the marks
  Then do a comma and the time per letter (do 0.1 for fast typing) then replace 'holdtim' with how long you want to wait till the code after the text runs, so do somthing like this: typeEffect("G4M3 3NG1N3",0.1,2)
  this will print 'G4M3 3NG1N3' spending 0.1 seconds on typing each letter, then it will hold and keep that on the screen for 2 seconds then run the rest of the code.

white()
 turns text after it white.
 Also it prints 1 blank line into the console

yellow()
 turns text after it yellow.
 Also it prints 1 blank line into the console

green()
 turns text after it green.
 Also it prints 1 blank line into the console
